    Spotify Web API

    You can use Spotify's Web API to discover music and podcasts, manage your Spotify library, control audio playback, and much more. Browse our available Web API endpoints using the sidebar at left, or via the navigation bar on top of this page on smaller screens.  In order to make successful Web API requests your app will need a valid access token. One can be obtained through <a href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/\">OAuth 2.0</a>.  The base URI for all Web API requests is `https://api.spotify.com/v1`.  Need help? See our <a href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/guides/\">Web API guides</a> for more information, or visit the <a href=\"https://community.spotify.com/t5/Spotify-for-Developers/bd-p/Spotify_Developer\">Spotify for Developers community forum</a> to ask questions and connect with other developers.

    Timbre is the quality of a musical note or sound that distinguishes different types of musical instruments, or voices. It is a complex notion also referred to as sound color, texture, or tone quality, and is derived from the shape of a segmentâ€™s spectro-temporal surface, independently of pitch and loudness. The timbre feature is a vector that includes 12 unbounded values roughly centered around 0. Those values are high level abstractions of the spectral surface, ordered by degree of importance.

For completeness however, the first dimension represents the average loudness of the segment; second emphasizes brightness; third is more closely correlated to the flatness of a sound; fourth to sounds with a stronger attack; etc. See an image below representing the 12 basis functions (i.e. template segments).
![timbre basis functions](https://developer.spotify.com/assets/audio/Timbre_basis_functions.png)

The actual timbre of the segment is best described as a linear combination of these 12 basis functions weighted by the coefficient values: timbre = c1 x b1 + c2 x b2 + ... + c12 x b12, where c1 to c12 represent the 12 coefficients and b1 to b12 the 12 basis functions as displayed below. Timbre vectors are best used in comparison with each other.
